 * Vouchsafe offers a REST API to conduct operations programmatically.

You can request and manage verifications, as well as perform smart lookups.

To use the API, you need a client ID and secret from the Vouchsafe dashboard. [Sign up here](https://app.vouchsafe.id/) if you haven't already.

We also have a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx6V6SSTMuF_ZNWBPnysvwmdIwboLViE8) showing the basics, as well as [SDKs and libraries](https://help.vouchsafe.id/en/articles/12026847-vouchsafe-sdks-and-libraries) for popular languages.
