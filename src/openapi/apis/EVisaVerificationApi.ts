 * Vouchsafe API docs
 * Vouchsafe offers a REST API to conduct operations programmatically.  You can request and manage verifications, as well as perform smart lookups.  To use the API, you need a client ID and secret from the Vouchsafe dashboard. [Sign up here](https://app.vouchsafe.id/) if you haven\'t already.  We also have a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx6V6SSTMuF_ZNWBPnysvwmdIwboLViE8) showing the basics, as well as [SDKs and libraries](https://help.vouchsafe.id/en/articles/12026847-vouchsafe-sdks-and-libraries) for popular languages.

This endpoint allows you to verify a person\'s `immigration status`, `right to work`, or `right to rent` eVisa by providing their share code and date of birth. The share code is obtained by the individual from the UK Home Office online service.  **Supported verification types:** - `ImmigrationStatus` - Check a person\'s immigration status (e.g., Settled, Skilled Worker, Youth Mobility Scheme) - `RightToWork` - Check a person\'s right to work in the UK - `RightToRent` - Check a person\'s right to rent property in the UK  > **Request behaviour:** This is a synchronous endpoint. It can take up to 20 seconds.  **Response fields by sub-type:** The response fields directly reflect the information available on a particular eVisa sub-type. On a `pass` outcome, all fields for the sub-type will be populated. On a `fail` outcome, `extracted_details` may be partially populated or empty depending on which validation step failed.  **Response summary:** | HTTP Status | Meaning | Action | |-------------|---------|--------| | `200` | Verification completed | Check the `outcome` field to determine if the verification was successful | | `422` | Share code locked out by GOV.UK | Retry with a new share code | | `503` | Service temporarily unavailable | Retry with exponential backoff |  **Billing:** An API call is billable when the eVisa was found on GOV.UK, regardless of whether the verification outcome is `pass` or `fail`. If the `share_code` or `date_of_birth` is invalid and no eVisa can be retrieved, the response will have `billable: false` and you will not be charged. Error responses (`HTTP 422`, `HTTP 503`) are also not billable and return an Error response body.  **Artefacts:** On a successful response, artefacts are returned inline with pre-signed download URLs. You have **30 minutes** to download them before the URLs expire.   **Sandbox testing:** Use these share codes in sandbox mode to test different outcomes: - `PASS12345` - Returns a successful verification with \"Pass\" outcome - `FAIL12345` - Returns a failed verification (e.g. expired status) - `ERROR1234` - Returns an error response - `BADCODE12` - Returns a non-billable failed verification (e.g. invalid share code) - `WRONGDOB1` - Returns a non-billable failed verification (e.g. wrong date of birth)  > This endpoint supports sandbox mode. [See how sandbox mode works](https://help.vouchsafe.id/en/articles/11979598-how-does-sandbox-mode-work).
